# Demo Application using Spring Boot
This project is based on a [Quick Start](https://spring.io/quickstart) guide to building web application using 
Spring Boot, which is an extension of a popular Java framework called Spring.

## Spring
It is application development framework of Java. The main feature of Spring is _**Dependency Injection**_ 
or _**Inversion of Control(IoC)**_. It is used to develop loosely coupled application.

## Spring Boot
It is a module of Spring. It allows us to build **_stand-alone_** application with minimal or zero 
configurations. It is used to develop simple Spring-based applications or RESTful services.

### Annotations
A form of metadata, provides data about a program that is not part of the program itself.
They have no direct effect on the code they annotate.
Annotation can be predefined or custom.

**Uses**-Declaration of classes, field, method and other program elements

NOTE:
* When we are creating a Maven project _mvnw_ and _mvnw.cmd_ files are created in the root of the project.
These files are **Maven wrapper** files and works similar to **Gradle wrapper**.
  

* This allows you to run Maven projects without having Maven installed and present on the path. It downloads 
  correct version by default in user directory.


* _mvnw_ file is for **Linux** and _mvnw.cmd_ file is for **Windows** environment.
 

* _pom.xml_ file(**Project Object Model**) contains information about project and configuration information 
  for Maven.It contains dependencies, build directory, source directory, test source directory, plugin, goal,
  etc. to build the project.


* Maven reads _pom.xml_ files then executes the goal.
